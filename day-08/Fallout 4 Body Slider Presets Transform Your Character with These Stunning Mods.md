Fallout 4 is a game that allows you to create and customize your own character, from their appearance to their clothing. But what if you want to tweak their body shape as well? That's where BodySlide presets come in handy. BodySlide presets are files that let you adjust various body sliders in the game, such as breast size, waist size, hip size, and more. You can use them to make your character look more realistic, more athletic, more curvy, or anything else you can imagine.

But how do you use BodySlide presets in Fallout 4? Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. First, you need to download and install two mods: [Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer (CBBE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15) and [BodySlide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25). CBBE is a mod that replaces the vanilla body meshes with more detailed and customizable ones. BodySlide and Outfit Studio is a tool that lets you edit and apply BodySlide presets to your character and outfits.
2. Next, you need to download and install a BodySlide preset that you like. There are many presets available on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/categories/53/), such as [Karma CBBE BodySlide preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/46112), [Lazman's Bodyslide Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23732), or [LooksMenu Body Sliders Extended](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36664). You can also create your own preset using BodySlide and Outfit Studio.
3. After installing the mods and the preset, launch BodySlide and Outfit Studio from your mod manager or from the Fallout 4 folder. In the main window, select your preset from the Preset drop-down menu. You can also adjust the sliders manually if you want to fine-tune your character's body.
4. Once you are happy with your character's body, click on Build at the bottom right corner. This will apply the preset to your character and any outfits that are compatible with CBBE. You can also preview how your character will look in different outfits by selecting them from the Outfit/Body drop-down menu.
5. Finally, launch Fallout 4 and enjoy your customized character. You can also change your character's body anytime by using the LooksMenu mod in-game. Just open the console and type slm 14 to open the LooksMenu interface. Then go to Body > Advanced > Load Preset and select your preset from the list. You can also save your current body settings as a new preset by clicking on Save Preset.

That's it! You have successfully customized your character's body in Fallout 4 with BodySlide presets. Have fun exploring the wasteland with your new look!

## Some Tips and Tricks for Using BodySlide Presets
 
Now that you know how to use BodySlide presets in Fallout 4, here are some tips and tricks that can help you get the most out of them:

- If you want to use different presets for different outfits, you can use the Batch Build feature in BodySlide and Outfit Studio. This will let you assign different presets to different outfits and build them all at once. To do this, click on Batch Build at the bottom left corner of the main window. Then select the outfits you want to build and the presets you want to use for each one. You can also use the Filter option to narrow down your choices. Once you are done, click on Build at the bottom right corner.
- If you want to make your character's body more consistent with their face, you can use the Sync feature in LooksMenu. This will let you copy the facial sliders to the body sliders and vice versa. To do this, open the LooksMenu interface in-game and go to Body > Advanced > Sync. Then choose whether you want to sync from face to body or from body to face. You can also sync specific sliders by clicking on them.
- If you want to make your character's body more realistic and immersive, you can use some mods that add physics and animations to your character and outfits. Some examples are [CBBE Physics](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2138), [CBP Physics](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22110), [OCBPC Physics](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39088), [CBBE Skimpy Armor and Clothing Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26809), [CBBE Ida Body Texture](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10371), and [CBBE Idle Animation](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20775). These mods will make your character's body move and react more naturally to gravity, movement, and clothing.
