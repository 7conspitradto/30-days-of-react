Woron Scan is a software program designed to work with GSM SIM cards. It allows users to read and edit the phone book, read IMSI and ICCID, and send direct commands to the SIM card using APDU. However, the main feature of Woron Scan is its ability to extract the KI (authentication key) from the SIM card, which can be used to clone the SIM card or perform other attacks.
